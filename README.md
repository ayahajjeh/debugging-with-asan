# Debugging with AddressSanitizer (ASan)
`This was my Project 4 for CS69.17 Software Security class at Dartmouth College.`

In this project, I use ASan to find bugs within a file compression program bzip2.c. 
bzip2.c is an implementation of the Linux command bzip2.
Please refer to the write-up pdf for more details on the project and my takeaways.
